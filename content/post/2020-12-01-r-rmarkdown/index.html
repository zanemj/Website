<h1>Data Cleaning</h1>
<p>This page contains a few small data visualizations that I created for CO2 emissions generated by UM Athletics facilities. The data was obtained from the Office of Campus Sustainability and you can see it portrayed in a much better (?) way on their website: <a href="https://ocs.umich.edu/resources/sustainability-data/building-energy-data/" class="uri">https://ocs.umich.edu/resources/sustainability-data/building-energy-data/</a></p>
<p>Before I could create the visualizations I had to clean up the data a bit and organize it the way I wanted.</p>

<h1>Visualizations</h1>
<p>I created a visualization for all of 2022â€™s emissions data associated with their scope 2 emissions. Scope 2 emissions are emissions associated with purchased electricity, steam, heating and cooling. Most buildings will only purchase electricity, and will generate their own heating, through natural gas furnace or electric heater. A few buidlings on campus purchase steam as the graph will show you.</p>
