Here is the link to the gitHub that this website was built from: <https://github.com/zanemj/Website>

Most of the work done by myself in R Markdown files is within the "content" folder -> "post" folder, the rest is mostly files generated by Hugo and blogdown when the website is initially created. I did also modify a few of the other files but nothing spectacular.
